## Development

```

Note: ~/.npmrc must be previously configured with access to github

## Proxy

## Troubleshooting

### Invalid hook

When running the lib-code-editor locally from IDE or another app, you might have an issue with invalid hooks with the following message: "Error: Invalid hook call. Hooks can only be called inside of the body of a function component."

To fix it, stop the development server of IDE (or the other app), stop the buildDev of lib-scene and run the following command in lib-scene repository root:

`npm link ../<app_directory_name>/node_modules/react`
```
